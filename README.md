# Attendance
My personal Flutter project that changes the experience with manual attendance and built for my teachers who uses google sheets to manually take the attendance which is way less efficient and much inconvinient.Thats why I built an app that will give smooth user experience and reduce the work of manually putting the dates . This app fetch datas automatically from the google sheet workbook and list the sheets as different courses.Then from the specific course it fetch the students and proceed to the taking attendance . When you press save it automatically create column with current date and save the records.

## Technical Description
This repo is the flutter (dart) codes that runs the front end do not carry the backend codes . That repo is different for deploying to server.
